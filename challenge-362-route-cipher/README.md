## Problem Description:
Given input string and direction, populate the string into an array of given dimension in a traditional left-to-right, up-to-down, manner. When encoding, use the same array as a reference, and create the encoded string by going through the array in a spiral in either clock-wise or counter-clockwise direction.

More detailed description and example can be found at the challenge link

## Files
route_cipher.py contains encode() which encodes given input string into route cipher
test_route_cipher.py is pytest module to test out the example string inputs from the code challenge link

## Status
Both clockwise and counterclockwise are implemented.
